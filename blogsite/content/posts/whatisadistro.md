what is a linux distro
what distro should i choose?
this can be a huge barrier to entry
tldr choose ubuntu server for server stuff 
and pop os for desktop

but like any big question it depends

these are some of the thing you need to consider
first is your linux knowledge
debian or based is the most common which mean that there is more softwarecompatible 

second is your hardware
if you have a very new hardware you may need a newer kernel

 third is your budget

what if i choose the wrong distro

there lot way to program from different 
one of the way is to using a universal package manager like flatpak or snaps

this comes some benefits
usual when you linux system it also the based packages that you need but you use for example flatpak you can a newer version than the base package
